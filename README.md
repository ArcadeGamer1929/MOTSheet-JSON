# MOTSheet-JSON

A tool for converting PD_Tool's MOT JSONs to CSV spreadsheets and vice-versa, useful for copying and moving around different parts of animations.\
It isn't a replacement for MOT Tool, the simplest way to put it is "dumbed down and complex edit mode".\
Can be used with or without the command line. LibreOffice Calc is highly recommended for editing and exporting CSV files. Made for PD_Tool (Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA mod tool) by ArcadeGamer1929.

#### Requires Python 3.
